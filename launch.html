            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>SpaceX’s first-ever launch took place on March 24, 2006, when the company attempted to send its Falcon 1
                rocket into orbit from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. This mission, named FalconSat, marked
                SpaceX’s
                debut in the orbital launch industry. Although the rocket failed roughly 25 seconds into flight due to a
                fuel leak and subsequent engine fire, the attempt demonstrated that a small, privately funded company
                could
                design, build, and launch its own orbital-class rocket—something previously done only by major
                governments
                or large aerospace contractors.</p>
            <p>Despite the failure, the launch proved pivotal for SpaceX. It validated many of the company’s design
                principles and gave engineers invaluable data that would feed into later successes. Over the next two
                years,
                SpaceX continued iterating on the Falcon 1, eventually achieving its first successful orbital launch in
                2008. That milestone made SpaceX the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit and
                set
                the stage for the company’s rapid rise, leading to the Falcon 9, Dragon, Crew Dragon, and Starship
                programs
                that define modern commercial spaceflight.</p>
